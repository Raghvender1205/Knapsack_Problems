///Implementation of 0/1 Knapsack using Branch and Bound
///How to find bound for every node for 0/1 Knapsack?
///--> Greedy Algorithm provides the best solution for Fractional Knapsack 
/**
 * To check if a particular node can give us a better solution or not, 
 * we compute the optimal solution (through the node) using Greedy approach. 
 * If the solution computed by Greedy approach itself is more than the best so far, 
 * then we canâ€™t get a better solution through the node
 * */

/**
 * Complete Algorithm:

.Sort all items in decreasing order of ratio of value per unit weight so that an upper bound can be computed using 
Greedy Approach.

.Initialize maximum profit, maxProfit = 0

.Create an empty queue, Q.

.Create a dummy node of decision tree and enqueue it to Q. Profit and weight of dummy node are 0.

.Do following while Q is not empty.

. Extract an item from Q. Let the extracted item be u.

. Compute profit of next level node. If the profit is more than maxProfit, then update maxProfit.

. Compute bound of next level node. If bound is more than maxProfit, then add next level node to Q.

. Consider the case when next level node is not considered as part of solution and add a node to 
queue with level as next, but weight and profit without considering next level nodes.

/**
 * Input:
// First thing in every pair is weight of item
// and second thing is value of item
Item arr[] = {{2, 40}, {3.14, 50}, {1.98, 100},
              {5, 95}, {3, 30}};
Knapsack Capacity W = 10

Output:
The maximum possible profit = 235

Below diagram shows illustration. Items are 
considered sorted by value/weight.
